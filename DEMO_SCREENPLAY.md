**Time:** 0:00 | **Duration:** 15s | **Type:** ESTABLISHING

**CAMERA:** DOLLY IN

**VOICEOVER:**
```
The human genome. 3 billion base pairs.
If you printed them out, they'd stretch from Earth to the Sun and back.
Yet it all fits in a nucleus smaller than a speck of dust.
```

**VISUALS:**
- Fade in: Black screen with single DNA helix
- Numbers counting up: 1... 1,000... 1,000,000... 3,000,000,000
- Pull back to reveal entire golden spiral galaxy

**DATA OVERLAY:**

**Time:** 0:15 | **Duration:** 20s | **Type:** DATA

**CAMERA:** STATIC

**VOICEOVER:**
```
The challenge: render 3 billion particles in real-time.
Traditional approaches would need 72 gigabytes of RAM.
Frame rates would drop to single digits.
The GPU would give up before even trying.
```

**VISUALS:**
- Split screen: Traditional renderer vs GenomeVedic
- Left side: Memory usage climbing, FPS dropping to 3
- Right side: Elegant streaming visualization at 104 FPS
- Code snippets flying by: voxel grid, frustum culling, streaming

### Scene 3: THE BREAKTHROUGH

**Time:** 0:35 | **Duration:** 10s | **Type:** ACTION

**CAMERA:** FLYTHROUGH

**VOICEOVER:**
```
The solution: Don't render everything. Stream what you need.
5 million voxels organize the genome.
Frustum culling shows only what's visible.
Result: 50,000 particles on screen. Always.
```

**VISUALS:**
- Camera flies through voxel grid
- Voxels light up as camera approaches
- Frustum cone highlights visible region
- Particle count stays constant: 50,000

**DATA OVERLAY:**

TP53, the guardian of the genome, shows 1,247 mutations in a single hotspot.
KRAS, EGFR, BRAF - the drivers of cancer - light up like warning beacons.
This isn't just data. These are people's lives.
```

Orange: Promoters, the switches that turn genes on.
Yellow: UTRs, the regulatory regions.
Every color, every particle, carries meaning.
```
