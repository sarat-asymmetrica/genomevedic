## 🔬 THE HYPOTHESIS (Codex Will Test)

**Claim:** Vedic digital root hashing creates biologically meaningful spatial clustering in genomic data.

**Testable Predictions:**
1. **Exons cluster together** (genes appear as spatial nebulae)
   - Test: Exon-to-exon distance < intergenic distance (p < 0.01?)

2. **Triplet codons with same function cluster** (Leucine codons near each other)
   - Test: CTT, CTC, CTA, CTG closer than random (p < 0.01?)

3. **Mutations cluster near genes** (>60% within 1kb of functional regions)
   - Test: Mutation-to-gene distance distribution vs random

4. **Golden spiral reveals Fibonacci gene spacing** (φ-based intervals)
   - Test: Gene spacings fit Fibonacci sequence (chi-square test)

**Outcome:**
- **If all tests pass (p < 0.01):** Digital root hashing captures biological structure → PUBLISH
- **If tests fail:** Hash function is aesthetic, not biological → Redesign with full agency

**This is REAL SCIENCE, not just engineering.**
